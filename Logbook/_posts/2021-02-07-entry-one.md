<h2>06/02/2021 Entry one </h2>
<p> It's a bit late (22:10), but something interesting for the first post. I think an interesting topic to dig into would be complex systems and, relatedly, theory of extreme events (low prob, high impact events). Relating the two formally might be tough but they are related, and very interesting frameworks to interpret world events in. I'll collect some items for a scratch bibliography and share them in the next entry. Inspiration for this comes from a recent convo between Zeynep Tufekci and Ezra Klein, I'll put that in the bib to come too.</p>
