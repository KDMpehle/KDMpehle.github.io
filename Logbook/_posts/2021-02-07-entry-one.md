<h2>07/07/2021 entry two</h2> 
<p> As promised, list of resources to investigate complex systems. In no particular order:
<ul>
	<li> Motivation for this topic was in the episode, <i> To understand this era, you need to think in systems</i> of the Ezra Klein show. There, Zeynep T&uumlfek&#231 and Ezra Klein discuss, among other things, systems thinking in the covid-19 pandemic. </li>
	<li> <i> Diversity and Complexity</i> by Scott E Page, investigating the role of diversity in complex systems. </li>
	<li><i> The Global Carbon Cycle </i> by David Archer, a primer in carbon cycling and geochemical cycles in the climate. </li> 	
	<li><i>Climate and Ecosystems</i> by David Schimel, exploring how climate and the biosphere influence eachother. </li>
	<li><i> Ant Encounters: Interaction Networks and Colony Behaviour</i> by Deborah M. Gordon. </li> 
	<li> On Modeling and Iterpreting the Economics of Catastrophic Climate Change</i>, an academic paper by Martin Weitzman about heavy tailed behaviour in economics related to disasters (low prob, high impact events).</li>
	<li> <i> Stability and Complexity in Model Ecosystems</i> by Robert May. Concerns the stability of populations in complex ecosystems via mathematical models.</li>
</ul>
There are many other resources one could consult. Many systems are 'complex', and a great way to learn about systems thinking would probably be to read widely in different fields, a suggestion Zeynep. A good field that she suggests is ecology, where ecosystems, as we all would recognise, present systems with many interacting parts. I would personally suggest that climate systems and geochemical cy cles are also good systems to study, there are a lot of interacting components and feedback loops in these systems. Some additional resources are the various books in the Princeton Primers in Climate series, as well as various books on the Princeton uni press website about ecosystems. I likely don't have time to read all these resources any time soon, but at the same time, the wide range of topics makes for an interesting reading list to pick and choose from.

<h2>06/02/2021 entry one </h2>
<p> It's a bit late (22:10), but something interesting for the first post. I think an interesting topic to dig into would be complex systems and, relatedly, theory of extreme events (low prob, high impact events). Relating the two formally might be tough but they are related, and very interesting frameworks to interpret world events in. I'll collect some items for a scratch bibliography and share them in the next entry. Inspiration for this comes from a recent convo between Zeynep Tufekci and Ezra Klein, I'll put that in the bib to come too.</p>
