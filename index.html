	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	<p>I want to create a personal webpage that is part blog, part logbook. A page that is in part a journal to scratch in short entries, and post quick links to media that draw my attention and interest; and also a space that motivates me to investigate topics I think are important, and write researched long pieces about them. I want to make clear one thing I certainly hope this site won't be: it is not intended to be an About Me page, a website dedicated primarily to highlighting my personal achievements and academic and professional qualifications. I wanted to make this preliminary, explicit proclamation because the latter style of website is a very common feature amoung aspiring STEM graduates and professionals, and I need to stress that this focus of this website should be the blog, not me. When the actual content of this website has been developed, I'll delete this foreword.
