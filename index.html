	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	<p>I want to create a personal webpage that is part blog, part logbook. A page that is in part a journal to scratch in short entries, post quick links to media that draw my attention and interest; and also a space that motivates me to investigate topics I think are important, and write longer, researched piecesabout them. I want to make clear one thing I certainly hope this site doesn't morph into: it is not an About Me page, in other words website primarily dedicatedto highlighting my personal achievements and academic and professional qualifications. I wanted to make this preliminary, explicit explanation because the latter style of website is a very common feature amoung aspiring STEM graduates and professionals, and I need to stress that this website is more about the blog. When the actual content of this website has been developed, I'll delete this forewod
