	<h1>Purpose</h1>
	<p>After a lot of talk and no walk, I've created this site, which is part blog, part logbook. The logbook section serves as a space for me to scratch short entries, and post quick links to media that draw my attention and interst; the blog is reserved for me to post longer, researched pieces. The two channels will end up interacting. For example, texts and links that I mark as interesting in the logbook will likely serve as the references for future blog posts, once I've read them.</p>
<p> I'm Khaya Mpehle, the author of this blog. Unfortunately, I'm launching this project at the same time I'm starting a graduate diploma, so there's every reason to be cynical about my commitment to posting regularly. But then again, I'm feeling pretty motivated (as of 6 Feb 2021), and  I've got a lot of interesting things to say, I promise you! </p>
